# Basic-pages-using-HTML
I have created a website consisting of five HTML pages. Separate sets of instructions
have been given for common features and page-specific features. 



Page-specific instructions:

1. Home Page: This is the first page to be accessed by a user of your website. The main section should
display your name, your onlinedegree roll number and an introduction about yourself.

2. Academics Page: On clicking the academics link, the user should be directed to the academics page.
The main section of this page should display your marks in tabular format under the heading “Mark
sheet” .
 
3. Personal Page: On clicking the personal link, the user should be directed to personal.html. The main
section must have two images and an external link .

4. Contact Page: On clicking the contact link, a new page with address and e-mail id should be displayed
using the address tag under a heading “Contact Us” in the main section .

5. Resume Page: On clicking the resume link, a new page should open whose main section should con-
tain a link “download resume” allowing the user to view your CV.
